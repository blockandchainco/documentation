# unblocked platform
The unblocked platform is a distributed computing platform which uses WebAssembly, dotnet core, Microsoft Blazor, WebRTC and IndexedDB to deliver a rapid app development solution for distributed applications.

## What are distributed applications?
Distributed applications are a part of Web 3.0 and allow the development of fully featured multi-user applications without the need for central server infrastructure.

## Why would I care?
Writing distributed applications on the unblocked platform is super simple, they scale enormously, offer world class security and require almost no investment to run.
