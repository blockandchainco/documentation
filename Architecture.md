# Architecture
The Unblocked platform was designed from the ground up to allow application developers to write applications with the following key attributes:

* **Run Anywhere** - Applications developed with the unblocked platform run on any modern web browser.
* **Include Full functionality data access** - Applications developed with the unblocked platform provide full featured data models and access
* **Require no backend** - Unblocked platform applications only require a flat file web server. There is no requirement for central databases or servers.
* **Are very secure** - Unblocked platform applications use a comprehensive X509 Certificate infrastucture and industry grade encryption and decryption.
* **Are highly scalable** - Processing occurs on users devices and data is shared peer-to-peer meaning these applications are highly scalable.
* **Are simple to write** - Unblocked platform applications are easy and quick to write
* **Uses your current knowledge** - Developers with an understanding of HTML, CSS and C# can easily write unblocked applications.

We've been developing this platform since the advent of the [Blazor](https://blazor.net) project to provide a way to solve some of our challenging technology issues. In January 2019, we decided to release our system as a platform that others can use to develop their own distributed applications.

At the core of the platform is a **distributed ledger**, using a technology that we developed purely in .net. Our distributed ledger implements end to end cryptography, merkle trees for speed, epochs
